        To create a nice user experience, we wanted to have a nice looking app. Not something that
        looked like a toddler made it. So we got some user experience people involved and the results
        were impressive. This sections presents some of the remaining screen shots of Cineasts.net.

        Some noteworthy things. Since Spring Data Graph reads through down to the database for property
        and relationship access, we tried to minimize that by using <code>&lt;c:var/&gt;</code> several times.
        The app contains very little javascript / ajax code right now, that will change when it moves ahead.
